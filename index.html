            My name is Anthony Pricer, and I am currently enrolled in SMU's Coding Bootcamp.
            Originally from Kansas City, Missouri, I moved to the DFW area in 2011 after honorably
            serving in the United States Marine Corps for nine years. I have a Bachelor of Business
            Studies and Master of Business Administration (Finance) degrees, both from Dallas Baptist
            University. I plan to use my newly acquired full stack developer skills with my previous
            military, civilian and education experience to meet and exceed organization goals.
        </p>
